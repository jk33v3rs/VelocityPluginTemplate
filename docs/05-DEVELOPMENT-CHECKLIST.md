## Notes for AI Development Process:

**CRITICAL REMINDERS:**
1. **ALWAYS** refresh context by reading documentation before each major section
2. **COMPLETE** each item fully before proceeding to the next
3. **VALIDATE** functionality after each component
4. **MARK** items as completed only when fully tested
5. **NO SHORTCUTS** - follow the plan systematically
6. **LEVERAGE** existing open source code wherever possible (67% target)
7. **MAINTAIN** focus on working functionality over perfect implementation

**Context Refresh Points:**
- Beginning of each Phase
- Before each major component (every 6-8 tasks)
- After any break in development process
- When switching between different functional areas
- Before final testing and deployment

This checklist ensures systematic, thorough development while maintaining the high standards and specific requirements outlined in the project documentation.
