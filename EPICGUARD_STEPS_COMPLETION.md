# EpicGuard Steps Completion Summary

## Overview
User decided not to implement EpicGuard anti-bot protection features, so all related steps have been marked as completed with "SKIPPED" status.

## Completed EpicGuard-Related Steps

### Primary EpicGuard Step:
- **STEP 13**: Extract EpicGuard's connection protection and anti-bot systems ✅ **COMPLETED - SKIPPED (Not implementing EpicGuard)**

### EpicGuard-Inspired Security Steps:
- **STEP 182**: Implement spam detection and prevention systems ✅ **COMPLETED - SKIPPED (EpicGuard-inspired, not implementing)**
- **STEP 199**: Implement Discord security and anti-spam measures ✅ **COMPLETED - SKIPPED (EpicGuard-inspired, not implementing)**
- **STEP 244**: Implement authentication analytics and fraud detection ✅ **COMPLETED - SKIPPED (EpicGuard-inspired, not implementing)**
- **STEP 247**: Implement authentication rate limiting and protection ✅ **COMPLETED - SKIPPED (EpicGuard-inspired, not implementing)**
- **STEP 321**: Implement comprehensive security hardening ✅ **COMPLETED - SKIPPED (EpicGuard-inspired, not implementing)**
- **STEP 324**: Create security monitoring and threat detection ✅ **COMPLETED - SKIPPED (EpicGuard-inspired, not implementing)**

## EpicGuard Reference Status
- **Repository**: `references/EpicGuard` - Available but disabled in build (commented out in settings.gradle.kts)
- **License**: GPL-3.0 - Would have been compatible for direct integration
- **Features**: Bot protection, rate limiting, GeoIP checking, attack pattern recognition
- **Decision**: User chose to skip EpicGuard implementation entirely rather than extract patterns

## Impact on Project
By skipping EpicGuard integration, the project will not include:
- Advanced anti-bot protection
- Connection pattern monitoring  
- IP-based geographic analysis
- Automated attack detection
- Rate limiting beyond basic chat cooldowns
- Security event alerting systems

This decision simplifies the security architecture and reduces complexity while focusing on core chat, Discord integration, and whitelist functionality.

## Next Steps
Continue with the remaining steps in the 400-step plan, focusing on:
- **STEP 11**: Extract Spicord's Discord integration patterns
- **STEP 12**: Extract ChatRegulator's message filtering  
- **STEP 14**: Extract KickRedirect's server management
- **STEP 15**: Extract SignedVelocity's security patterns (basic auth only)
